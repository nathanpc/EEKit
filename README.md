## Why Visual Basic 6?

As you can clearly see, this program was written using the ancient VB6 language,
the reason for this is fairly simple: It works on almost any version of Windows,
from the XP to 10 without any issues and it makes programming really fun.

In my humble opinion VB6 is a great way to develop a nice looking professional
GUI without wasting too much time and having lots of fun. If I did this using,
let's say C#, I would waste a lot of time trying to make sure I had everything
neatly wrapped into classes and good programming practices like that, but with
VB6 I can create something nice very fast, and for internal programs like this,
this powerful tool is indispensable and saves me from wasting way too much time
making sure the code is absolutely perfect.
